# JMJPFU
### 13-Mar-2017

This notebook will detail out the SVM implementation and its nuances. Will try out the following

1. Base SVM model
2. SVM model with tune grid
3. Demonstrate this model with transformations
4. Visualisaation of this model with class related distributions and get some intuitions.


### Initial tasks : Seeting up the library functions

```{r}
library(caret)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```


### Step 1 : Setting the train-Control and training the models.


```{r}
trainCon <- trainControl(method="repeatedcv",number=10,repeats=3)

set.seed(7)

metrics = "accuracy"

svmModel <- train(label~.,data=xTrain,method='svmRadial',metric=metrics,trControl=trainCon)


```
